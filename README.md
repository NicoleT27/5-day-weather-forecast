Weather dashboard

## Description

This webpage allows the user to input their city of choice or select a common city from the side menu and it will display the current temperature, wind speed as well as humidty percentage. It will also provide the 5 day forecast for that selected city and their details as well.

## Usage

At the start of the page you are able to see the current city is blank, insinuating that the user either click a common city or input one.
![Main page without city ](/Assets/images/)

The user will then wither pick the common city off of the side menu or type in the city and hitting search
![Search input/Side Menu](/Assets/images/)

Once the user has clicked the common city or inputed their prefered city the page will provide the current weather forecast of that day as well as the forecast for the next 5 days
